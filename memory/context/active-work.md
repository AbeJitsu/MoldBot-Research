# Active Work

## Current Project
- **Project:** Bridgette (Native Claude Code Dashboard)
- **Path:** ~/Projects/Personal/OpenClaw Research
- **Branch:** dev (all work happens here, merged to main when stable)
- **Status:** Core features complete, polish phase

## What's Done (Recent)
- Task priorities — High/normal/low with red border highlights, sorting, click-to-cycle button
- Responsive layout — Auto-collapse sidebars under 1024px, icon-only tabs on mobile, wrapped navigation
- Eval task deduplication — Skips creating needs_testing task when one already exists for that eval type
- Connection cleanup — Rate limit counters cleaned up on stale connections, advance-all rejects same-status transitions
- Scroll-to-bottom always visible — Button appears whenever user scrolls up, not just during streaming
- Tool card a11y — aria-expanded and aria-label on expand/collapse buttons
- Memory editor empty state — Shows placeholder when no files exist

## Next Steps
- Code syntax highlighting in markdown
- Approval buttons for tool use
- Multiple sessions support

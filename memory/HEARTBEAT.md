# HEARTBEAT.md

# Keep this file empty (or with only comments) to skip heartbeat checks.
# Add tasks below when you want periodic monitoring.

# Example tasks:
# - Check if Next.js dashboard is running (curl localhost:3000/api/health)
# - Check launchd job status (launchctl list | grep openclaw)
# - Review memory files for stale content
